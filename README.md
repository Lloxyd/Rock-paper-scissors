I developed a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players can interact with a visually appealing interface to make their choice. The HTML structure provides buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors, while CSS enhances the aesthetics with styled buttons and responsive design. JavaScript powers the game logic, generating the computer's random choice, comparing it with the player's selection, and determining the outcome. The result is dynamically displayed on the screen, creating an engaging and interactive experience for users to enjoy this classic game online.
